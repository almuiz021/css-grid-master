# Nexter - CSS Grid and SCSS Project

## Overview

Nexter is a front-end project built to explore and demonstrate the power of
**CSS Grid** and **SCSS** for creating modern, responsive layouts. This project
showcases a real estate-inspired website layout, focusing on clean design,
modular SCSS architecture, and advanced CSS Grid techniques.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Utilizes CSS Grid to create a flexible and responsive
  design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **SCSS Architecture**: Organized SCSS structure with partials, variables,
  mixins, and nesting for maintainable and scalable styles.
- **Modern Design**: Clean, minimalistic UI with a focus on real estate property
  listings.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested to ensure consistent rendering across
  modern browsers.
- **Custom Animations**: Subtle hover effects and transitions for enhanced user
  experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for the structure.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating complex, responsive layouts.
- **SCSS**: For modular and maintainable stylesheets with features like
  variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **BEM Methodology**: For consistent and scalable CSS class naming.

## What I Learned

- **CSS Grid**:
  - Creating responsive grid layouts with `grid-template-columns`,
    `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap`.
  - Using `grid-template-areas` for intuitive layout design.
  - Implementing overlapping elements and complex layouts with minimal code.
  - Handling responsive design with `minmax()`, `auto-fit`, and `auto-fill`.
- **SCSS**:
  - Organizing styles with partials (e.g., `_base.scss`, `_variables.scss`).
  - Using variables for consistent theming (colors, fonts, spacing).
  - Creating reusable mixins for responsive breakpoints and common styles.
  - Leveraging nesting and the `&` operator for cleaner code.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Combining CSS Grid with media queries for adaptive layouts.
  - Utilizing SCSS functions and mixins to streamline responsive styling.
- **Workflow Improvements**:
  - Setting up a development environment with SCSS compilation (e.g., using
    `sass` CLI or build tools).
  - Structuring a project for scalability and collaboration.
  - Applying BEM for maintainable CSS class naming.
